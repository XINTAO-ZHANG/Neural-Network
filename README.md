Me and my teammates built a learning algorithm that is able to detect certain arrhythmia patterns in an Electrocardiogram(EKG). The algorithm takes in a piece of EKG and signal if certain arrhythmia pattern is present in the diagram.
The algorithm contained a model with 3 hidden neural layers, each containing 8, 16, and 32 units. The program utilized back-propagation to modify the neural connection weights. In 50 Epoch, this program was able to achieve 97.03% accuracy on the testing data set.
For detailes of this algorithm, please refer to the final-project-writeup file.
